# Apigee Monitoring Extension for AppDynamics #
 #### Tested with Apigee Edge ####
 
## Use Case ###

Apigee is an API management platform that enables developers and businesses to design, secure, deploy, monitor, and scale APIs. This extension makes it possible for AppDynamics customers to monitor the performance of Apigee API proxies.

The Apigee monitoring extension help AppDynamics customers to quickly isolate the root cause of performance issues - whether it is Apigee's overhead and/or the backend (target) service. The extension monitors API proxy performance metrics such as Total Error count, Traffic rate, Response Time and Error response codes. Also, it has an optional built-in feature to analyse and report on API proxy performance metrics using the AppDynamics BiQ platform - this gives customers the extra flexibility of slicing and dicing API proxy and target errors for reporting and continues enhancements purposes.

The extension now supports monitoring for multiple Apigee instances, environments and orgs - in any combination of your choice.
 
**Metrics** that are collected for each API proxy are :

1. **Response Time:**  Total number of milliseconds it took to respond to a call. This time includes the Apigee API proxy overhead and your target server time.
2. **Target Response Time:**  Number of milliseconds it took your target server or service to respond to a call. This number tells you how your own services are behaving.
3. **Overall Average Response Time:**  Overall Average Response Time for all proxies - it's calculated by summing the response times and divided by the number of proxies available at the time. 
4. **Request Processing Latency:** Number of milliseconds from the time when a call reaches the selected API proxy to the time when Apigee sends the call to your target server.
5. **Traffic:** The number of recorded API requests for each API proxy
6. **Error:**  The total number of times API proxies failed over the specified period. Proxy failure can occur when a policy fails or when there's a runtime 
7. **Error Count Sum:** Summation of errors for all API proxies  
8. **4XX Count:** The total number of 4XX HTTP Response Code for each API proxy 
9. **4XX Sum:** Summation of 4XX HTTP Response Codes in all API proxies
10. **5XX Count:** The total number of 5XX HTTP Response Code for each API proxy 
11. **5XX Sum:** Summation of 5XX HTTP Response Codes for all API proxies


## Prerequisite ###
1. This extension works only with the standalone Java machine agent. 
2. Analytics module must be enabled in Apigee 
2. Create a service account in Apigee that has read access to all ALL the API proxies you would like to monitor in AppDynamics 
3. jq must be installed on the server running the machine agent - https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/ 

### Installation ###
1. Unzip the attached file into $MACHINE_AGENT_HOME/monitors 
2. Using your favourite text editor, open config.json and fill in the configuration properties:

  | **Config Property Name** | **Description** |
  | --- | --- |
  | host_url  | Apigee host url, including the port number if required. |
  | metric_prefix  | Define metrics prefix, for example:  `Server|Component:<tier-name>|Custom Metrics|Apigee ` . Please do not add `|` at the end. |
  | org  | Select the organization that contains the proxies you would like to monitor |
  | env  | Select the environment that contains the proxies you would like to monitor. prod, Dev, Prod, etc.  |
  | server_friendly_name  | An free text indicator that best describes your Apigee environment, org, or environment. use - or _ to separate words, not spaces |
  | username | Username of the read-only service account  |
  | password | Password of the read-only service account |
  | use_proxy-filter  | If set to true, the monitoring extension will only collect metrics for proxies that are defined in the `apipproxy.conf` file |
  | enable_BiQ  | If set to true, the monitoring extension will send proxy and target response codes to BiQ platform. This requires BiQ license|
  | analytics_endpoint  | This is the analytics endpoint of your controller. This differs depending on the location of your controller. Please refer to this [doc](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PAA/Onprem-DC1+Domains+and+IP+Ranges). |
  | global_account_name  | You can get the global account name to use from the [License page](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/latest/License+Management)  |
  | analytics_key | Create the analytics API Key by following the instruction in this [doc](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/latest/Managing+API+Keys).  Grant Manage, Query and Publish permissions to Custom |
  | proxy_url  | Define proxy host if in use, otherwise leave blank.  |
  | proxy_port | Define proxy port if `proxy_url` is not blank |

3. Version 2.0 and above of this extension support monitoring of multiple Apigee instances, environments or organisations. To do this, add an element to the connection details array as shown below. Note, use a unique `server_friendly_name` for each entry. 
`````
 {
      "host_url": "https://localhost:8080",
      "org": "customer1",
      "env": "prod",
      "server_friendly_name": "Onpremise-Sever001-DC1",
      "username": "username",
      "use_proxy_filter": true,
      "password": "password"
    }
`````
4. If `use_proxy_filter` is set to true, list the target proxies in the `apipproxy.conf` file - one item per line. 

  *Note: user_proxy_filter, when set to true will ONLY send API performance metrics for the predefined proxies in the
   apiproxy.conf file. If set to false, performance data for ALL apigee proxies in the `org` and `env` will be collected.* 

5. prod it: `./apigee_monitor.sh`
6. If everything is OK, you should see an output in stdout that is similar to this: 
`````

Do not proceed until you get an output similar to the above. 

6. Restart the machine agent 

Note: The Global* metric is synonymous with AppDynamics baseline metric. We recommend that you use the non-Global metrics for your health rule metrics. 

###  BiQ Output ###

If BiQ is enabled, you can now slice and dice Apigee metrics in many dimensions to suit your business needs, for example:  

`SELECT * FROM apigee_metrics WHERE total_response_time > 5 and four_xx > 0 and environment="prod" SINCE 2 hours`

###  Custom Dashboard ###
The custom dashboard below shows 2 API proxy performance metrics - with their respective SLAs

Metrics are located in Application Infrastructure Performance | Tier_NAME| Custom Metrics | Apigee |*

### Troubleshooting ###

1. Review $MACHINE_AGENT_HOME/logs/apigee-monitor.log 

2. Check the analytics page in Apigee and ensure you can see performance data for the proxy APIs in the correct org and env 

3. Send a manual curl request to your apigee instance to verify it's working

4. If you need to contact support, reload the Apigee analytics page, save [HTTP HAR file](https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-do-I-create-a-HAR-File-to-troubleshoot-web-download-issues/ta-p/23373) and attach it to the support case.
