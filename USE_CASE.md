# Apigee Monitoring Extension for AppDynamics

Apigee is an API management platform that enables developers and businesses to design, secure, deploy, monitor, and scale APIs. This extension makes it possible for AppDynamics customers to monitor the performance of Apigee API proxies.

The Apigee monitoring extension help AppDynamics customers to quickly isolate the root cause of performance issues - whether it is Apigee's overhead and/or the backend (target) service. The extension monitors API proxy performance metrics such as Total Error count, Traffic rate, Response Time and Error response codes. Also, it has an optional built-in feature to analyse and report on API proxy performance metrics using the AppDynamics BiQ platform - this gives customers the extra flexibility of slicing and dicing API proxy and target errors for reporting and continues enhancements purposes.

The extension now supports monitoring for multiple Apigee instances, environments and orgs - in any combination of your choice.
